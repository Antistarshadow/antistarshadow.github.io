    <h1>Hi there, I'm Rob, aka Starshadow!</h1>
	<p>This is under construction right now as I come to grips with Jekyll and Github pages! The blog is starting up, and I'll work on filling up the About me page too (see links in the upper right).</p>
	<p>Looks like lead pages are going to be html and posts written in markdown, so don't be surprised by that.</p>
