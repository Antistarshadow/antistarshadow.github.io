    <h3>Welcome! My name is Rob, a new academic librarian making the switch from federal librarianship.</h3>
	<p>This website is a place for me to blog about my transition from the federal government to academia, and whatever else I feel like writing about. It's also a place to experiment with web technology because who doesn't have fun messing around with new stuff?</p>
	<p>This website is under construction right now as I come to grips with Jekyll and Github pages. The blog is starting up however (as seen below), and I'll work on filling up the About me page too (link in the upper right).</p>
	<p>Looks like lead pages are going to be html and posts written in markdown, so don't be surprised by that. Which you probably won't be if you're familiar with these sytles of static websites.</p>
