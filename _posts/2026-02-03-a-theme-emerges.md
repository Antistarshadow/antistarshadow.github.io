title: A Theme Emerges
---

I have been working diligently on the website to get it into an "acceptable" state, meaning something that I can live with for now. I started off with a very barebones style, basically using a touch of css to style the site. But now I'm migrating over to the "minima" Jekyll theme and things are looking *slightly* better.

It's been a slow process because I'm doing it piecemeal instead of importing the theme into a branch, adjusting things there, then merging into the main branch like a sane person would. I blame my relative lack of experience with Github, and also the fact that I'm doing all the work via browser instead of working locally (the joys of working from a work computer). But I'll get set up on one of my other computers eventually and things will go smoother in that future.

Is this really worthy of a post? Not really, but I did want to document for myself that I have been hard at work behind-the-scenes to get this site ready. And I have been *slowly* learning some of the intricacies of Jekyll, which in some neat ways is pretty simple. That should make the blog easy to maintain and work with, meaning that I'll actually be able to stick with it. Hope springs eternal!

Now to maybe work on that "About Me" page...
